# AI-LIP-READING

Hello, Students and Project enthusiasts Thank you for being here!
All my suggestion is when you go to someone's Repo, at first read the "README.md" file, because they may provide a proper explanation towards their repository.

All the best for your Project!

I've Done this project with the Guidance of "Nicholas Renotte" through his YouTube video: LIPNET---> https://youtu.be/uKyojQjbx4c?si=S6q7lRbzgmIB-r9J

In case: If Nicholas you are watching this!!! Thank you so much, man! I've learned very much from you and I'm very grateful for the knowledge that you have shared through YOUTUBE

**What is different from the original project done by Nicholas??**
I've solved the problem of file allocation to the pipeline by directly keeping all the (text + description) files in the same folder, and changed the function to make the final product!

I hope that works for you :)

In case of any doubts please reach out to: pusalabhuvansaikrishna@gmail.com

*Suggestion:* Please use your Drive and mount it directly to your Colab notebook to save space at your local machineðŸš€

Look at "About_Files.txt" dataset information.
